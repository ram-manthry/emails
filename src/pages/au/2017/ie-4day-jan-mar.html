                New Inner Engineering Total (4 Day)<br>
                <small>Conducted by a trained teacher</small>
            </p>

            <p>
                We are happy to announce that, after 4 years Isha Australia is re-introducing the
                live Inner Engineering program designed by Sadhguru and conducted by a trained teacher.
                Previously offered as a 7-day course, it is now offered as a 4-day weekend programme with brand
                new content.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="highlight section-title-medium">What is Inner Engineering?</p>
            <p>
                Inner Engineering is a comprehensive system, derived from the ancient science of yoga,
                to establish a deep and lasting personal transformation. It is a method of aligning your body,
                mind, emotions and energies to function at their peak and in complete harmony.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><em>The program includes Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya</em></strong> - a powerful 21-minute inner energy process
                that incorporates the breath; when practiced regularly, this 21-minute kriya can bring 
                the following various benefits into one's life.

            Many of you have expressed a desire in the past to go through Inner Engineering Online program again.
            After 5 years, this opportunity has become available again for all of us to go through Live Inner Engineering program.
            This is an ideal opportunity for us to listen to Sadhguru again as a volunteer and imbibe the tools of Inner Engineering
            to a much deeper and experiential level.
        </p>
        <p>Sadhguru's words on volunteering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/sadhguru/masters-words/volunteering-giving-yourself/">
                    Volunteering - Giving Yourself</a>

                What it means to be a volunteer</a>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You are encouraged to attend all 4 days of the program.
            If that's not possible, you are welcome to attend any session at your convenience.
            However, please arrive before the start of the session and attend it in its entirety.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Sunday, you are required to be there for the full day.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be having a volunteer meet for those who wish to volunteer for this program, closer to the program date.
            Due to high demand and limited capacity, volunteers are required to register using corresponding links below.
