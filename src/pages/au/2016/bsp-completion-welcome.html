			<p class="highlight">Dear {{{{raw}}}}{{FIRST_NAME}}{{{{/raw}}}},</p>
			<p>We hope you had a powerful and inspirational weekend, and are still carrying the experience from the recent Bhava Spandana
				program. We would love to hear about your experience of the BSP. Please share it by clicking
				<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ishafoundation.org/forms/d/1CkUo4qgTjpBQ6NZAzQ3kHivhhpHfT3wVn2q0nL1DYA8/viewform">here</a>.
				Many of you might be wondering, how to keep the essence of Bhava Spandana alive within, this is what Sadhguru says...</p>
			<hr>
			<p><span style="font-size: 24px">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-family: 'Papyrus'; font-size: 20px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.6em;">
					The whole process of yoga is to give yourself. It is possible to simply sit, close your eyes and give yourself to
					the world. But that level of awareness is not there in most human beings. Without activity, most people may not know how
					to give themselves. They need action to give themselves to something. Volunteering is a tremendous possibility in that direction
					â€“ you can offer yourself through your work.</span> <span style="font-size: 24px">&rdquo;</span></p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The program photos will soon be uploaded on our facebook page. Please like our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IshaYogaAustralia"
					target="_blank">facebook page</a> to keep yourself posted.
			</p>
			<p>So if you are looking for some meaningful activity to get involved with please fill this <a href="http://ishayoga.org.au/volunteer-registration/"
					target="_blank">form </a>if you have not already done so. No matter what your skills or experience, or how much time you
				are able to commit, if you are willing, we welcome you to contribute in making Isha reach to many more people that may
				reap the benefits</p>
			<p>If you have a longing to be in the physical presence of Sadhguru, please check 
				for <a href="http://www.ishayoga.org/Schedule/Sadhguru" target="_blank">Sadhguru's schedule</a></p>
			<p><strong>For now, the first thing you can do to keep the Bhava Spandana alive is attending the Isha monthly gatherings near you. (Schedule below)</strong>
				Here, you will get to practice Shambhavi together and also watch a video discourse by Sadhguru. Sometimes there are special
				guided meditations for you to enjoy.</p>
			<p>
				We look forward to seeing you at the next monthly gathering and hope that you continue to bask in the Bhava Spandana.
			</p>
			<p>
				With Love and Joy<br>Isha Volunteers
