            <p>This is a process offered every Shivaratri at the Dhyanalinga to purify the five elements within the human system.
                The basis of all creation, including the physical body, is the five elements.
                The wellbeing of the body and mind can be determined by the purity of the five elements within the human system.
                This purification process also shapes the body to become a stepping-stone towards one's ultimate wellbeing,
                rather than remain a hurdle to one’s growth. To hear Sadhguru, watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFsrEWEbP6g">Pancha Bhuta Aradhana
