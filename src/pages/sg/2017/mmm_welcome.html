                    Dear Self,<br/><br/>
                    It is my endeavor and privilege to remind you that it is very much<br/>
                    in your grasp to take charge of all that concerns your well-being.<br/>
                    It is time that humanity addresses human well-being in a scientific<br/>
                    manner to take our lives beyond the beliefs that we fight and kill for,<br/>
                    philosophies that we debate and disagree, ideas and ideologies that<br/>
                    divide us, to offer humanity technologies for well-being that we only<br/>
                    have to learn to use.<br/><br/>

                    Be a part of this movement in moving humanity inward<br/>
                    as all human experience is generate from within.<br/>
                    May you know the joy of Being.<br/><br/>
                    I am with you. Let us make it happen,
                </p>
