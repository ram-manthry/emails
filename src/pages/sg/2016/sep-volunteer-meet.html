            <p>Volunteering being at the very core of Isha, it is with great joy that we announce the first General Volunteer Meet for 2016, before next sathsang.</p>

            <p>
                This is an opportunity open to all those wishing to dedicate time in volunteering, in whichever capacity that you can.
                This meet will introduce the spirit of volunteering within Isha as a complete path for growth.
                It will also explore the various volunteering opportunities available with Isha in Singapore and introduce you to the existing team of volunteers
                who have been supporting the Foundation over the last few months and years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this video, Sadhguru very beautifully shares what it means to be a Volunteer.

                Recently, during the "In the Lap of the Master" event, Sadhguru also revealed,
                "The coming twelve years will be the golden age for spirituality on the planet.
                In many ways, it will be a time of great possibilities. When we move into top gear, it will be a good speed,
                a good time for the spiritual movement, for Isha, and for all of you..." (For the full article, please <a href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/sadhguru/spot/on-the-threshold-of-a-golden-age/">click here</a>)
            </p>
            <p><strong>You're in for a very special surprise real soon. Please take note of the special announcement at the end of this email.</strong></p>
            <p>
                To volunteer, one doesn't have to do the big things to make a difference; how it is done is what makes all the difference.
                If reaching out to people comes naturally to you, you could volunteer to make the calls from the comfort of your home.
                If working on a computer is convenient for you, you could offer to do the data entry work. If there is an organiser in you,
                you can opt to help with venue setup and in organising other details. There is always something that you can help with based on your time availability,
                at the same time using this to grow forward in your inner journey.

                        "I was told volunteering deepens your experience and takes it to a different level
                        and I wondered how can carrying mats and cutting vegetables impact anything within...
                        but I was willing, willing to do it and see for myself. How small things impacted I did not notice immediately,
                        but it transformed me before I knew it. What happened I still don't know but I am happier, more balanced,
                        focused in whatever role I am playing, whether I am a daughter, sister, wife, mother or banker... I am the best I can be at that moment...
                        much more aware of the inevitability of this moment."
