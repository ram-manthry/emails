                We will be offering the next Inner Engineering completion program (previously known as
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWm-CztZqsg">Shambhavi Mahamudra</a> program) on
                October 15th &amp; 16th.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shambhavi Mahamudra is an ancient kriya that has millions of dedicated practitioners who aver that they
                experience greater emotional balance, concentration, focus, stability and better health with regular
                practice of the meditation. In fact, there have been many scientific studies that measure various benefits
                of practicing the kriya regularly. To know more, please click

                As you all may know already, Isha Yoga is run entirely by volunteers and Sadhguru has spoken how it is
                an essential part of one&rsquo;s inner growth. To read more, please click
                <a href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/sadhguru/masters-words/volunteering-giving-yourself/">here</a>.

                It was highly motivating to see a large number of new volunteers turning out for September volunteer
                meet. Many of you have already submitted the forms to register your preference to volunteer for various
                activities in the upcoming programmes as well as January event with Sadhguru. For those who could not
                make it in September but you would like to volunteer regularly, you can register your interest as a
                volunteer <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F55tf46mxDIEyrp5l6ZtWE0pMeGFHbtCES-4iLc1mQI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next Volunteer Meet (details below) will also focus on Sadhguru&rsquo;s January event besides regular
                Isha programs and is mandatory for all who wish to volunteer for this event.

                This is an opportunity to mingle outside for a nature walk amidst fresh air, chirping birds and green
                trees. So, get your walking shoes and join us along with your family for this walk followed by
                breakfast. After breakfast, we will proceed straight for volunteer meeting. We look forward to
                seeing many of you on 22nd morning.
