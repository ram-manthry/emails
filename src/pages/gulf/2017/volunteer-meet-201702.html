                Isha Foundation is almost entirely volunteer run. Every single action and activity of the Foundation and its worldwide centers is done on a volunteer basis. Inspired and deeply transformed by their own experience of Inner Engineering and Sadhguru, Isha volunteers seek to inspire and nurture this possibility in every person, helping them realize the ultimate potential within.

                    “The whole process of yoga is to give yourself. It is possible to simply sit, close your eyes and give yourself to the world. But that level of awareness is not there in most human beings. Without activity, most people may not know how to give themselves. They need action to give themselves to something. Volunteering is a tremendous possibility in that direction – you can offer yourself through your work.”
