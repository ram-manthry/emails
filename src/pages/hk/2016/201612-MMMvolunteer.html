            <p>
                What a blessing to begin this new year with a call by Sadhguru! :) In spite of his very hectic schedule,
                he took time out to speak to all of us from USA.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Sadhguru mentioned, it is important that we go all out in reaching out to those whom we know and
                letting them know that this possibility is available. It is upto them whether they will make use of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have just 18 days remaining before he will be with us and let us leave aside all our inhibitions and
                offer this to everyone around us!

                    You can share any message with multiple people through WhatsApp with just one click if you have a
                    broadcast list. Please note this is NOT a GROUP, which means they receive the message like one to
                    one communication. However for them to receive it, they need to have your phone stored in their
                    phonebook.

                        And within 1 hour of posting I had 10 ticket requested to be booked on their behalf. These
                        weren't family as I hv already bought them tickets earlier. Randomly picking friends whom I

                    “ My first physical encounter with him was at a evening sathsang in Ashram. The first sentence he
                    uttered completely blew my mind. It was exactly something I was always running from but at the same
                    time always knew to be true. He spoke about how if we don't go beyond the limitations of our mind we
                    can't know life in its entirety. Mind is the only thing I had worked on till then, and I had seen
                    it's limitations. After that he answered many questions people asked but it felt like everything was
                    being said to me personally.<br><br>
                    I secretly thought that this is all a setup to get me here and tell me all these things I needed to
                    hear. I wondered how he knew me so well. I wondered if he ever came to Chandigarh when I was a young
                    boy and saw me and knew exactly who I was.<br><br>
                    Then again I saw him at ashram at one more evening sathsang and while leaving he just looked at me
                    once. It was just a glance, but I felt like he knew exactly who I am. Like he knew much more about
                    me than myself. It's hard to forget the intensity in his eyes. Hard to forget and hard to explain.
                    Since then I've seen him only a few times in person but the intimacy of this bond has grown
                    beautifully with time. What started as a pure intellectual pursuit, perhaps an intellectual
                    challenge, has now evolved into a loving long distance relationship. In any normal circumstances one
                    could call it one sided love affair. But with Sadhguru, it would be a big mistake to call it one
                    sided.”
