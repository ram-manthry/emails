                We are happy to announce that for the first time, Isha Hongkong is introducing the 4-day in-person
                Inner Engineering program with brand new content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designed by Sadhguru and conducted by a trained teacher, this program includes all aspects of Inner
                Engineering and Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya and doesn't require any pre-requisite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Live chinese translation will also be available!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="highlight section-title-medium">What is Inner Engineering?</p>
            <p>
                Inner Engineering is a comprehensive system, derived from the ancient science of yoga,
                to establish a deep and lasting personal transformation. It is a method of aligning your body,
                mind, emotions and energies to function at their peak and in complete harmony.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><em>The program includes Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya</em></strong> - a powerful 21-minute inner energy process
                that incorporates the breath; when practiced regularly, this 21-minute kriya can bring
                <a href="https://www.innerengineering.com/ieo-new/benefits/" target="_blank">various benefits</a> into one's life.

        <p>
            The live "Inner Engineering Total" program is an ideal opportunity for us to listen to Sadhguru once again
            as a volunteer and imbibe the tools of Inner Engineering to a much deeper and experiential level.
        </p>
        <p>Sadhguru's words on volunteering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/sadhguru/masters-words/volunteering-giving-yourself/">
                    Volunteering - Giving Yourself</a>
            </li><li>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D76Pheq8zps">
                What it means to be a volunteer</a>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We strongly encourage you to attend all 4 days of the program to imbibe the class aspects of Inner
            Engineering in a complete step by step manner. If that's not possible, you can attend any session at your
            convenience but please arrive before the start of the session and attend it in its entirety.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Sunday, you are required to be there for the full day.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be having a volunteer meet for those who wish to volunteer for this program, closer to the program date.
